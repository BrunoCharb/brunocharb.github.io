<p class="ion-margin-start">Your toes are adapted for gripping and climbing. You gain the Combat Climber feat as a bonus feat, and as long as you aren't wearing footwear, you can use the sticky pads on your feet to climb, leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you roll a success on an Athletics check to climb, you get a critical success instead.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">Your body is light with flaps of skin along your limbs that catch the air that passes beneath you. As long as you can act and have enough room, you can open the flaps to slow any fall just enough to avoid taking damage (whether you have the room to do so depends on the GM's discretion).</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">Your thick scales help you retain water and combat the sun's glare. You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). Environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for you, and you can go 10 times as long as normal before you are affected by starvation or thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear or take shelter, environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">You can change your skin color to blend in with your surroundings, making minor shifts with a single action and dramatic changes over the course of an hour. When you're in an area where your coloration is roughly similar to the environment (for instance, forest green in a forest), you can use the minor, single action application of this ability to make localized changes that help you blend into your surroundings, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks until your surroundings change in coloration or pattern.</p>
