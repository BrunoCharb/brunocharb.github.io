    <p>Your ancestors' innate resistance to magic surges, before slowly ebbing down. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus until the end of this turn. This bonus also applies to the triggering save.</p>

  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Anvil Dwarf</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You are a descendant of a famed crafter and have your own amazing talent. Other dwarves might consider this a blessing from your ancestors or from the Forgefather himself, depending on where you grew up. You become trained in Crafting (or another skill if you were already trained in Crafting) and gain the Specialty Crafting skill feat, but you can pick two different specialties instead of one.</p>

  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Death Warden Dwarf</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your ancestors have been tomb guardians for generations, and the power they cultivated to ward off necromancy has passed on to you. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a necromancy effect, you get a critical success instead. </p>

  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Elemental Heart Dwarf</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Whether through a connection to Torag's forge, the azers of the Plane of Fire, or another source, you can exude a burst of energy. Mbe'ke and Taralu dwarves of the Mwangi Expanse believe this heritage is a gift from dragons or elemental spirits. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Once chosen, this can't be changed. You gain the Energy Emanation activity.</p>

    <p class="separator"></p>
    <p>Energy bursts forth from your body. You deal 1d6 damage of your chosen type to all adjacent creatures (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d6.</p>

  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Forge Dwarf</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You have a remarkable adaptation to hot environments from ancestors who inhabited blazing deserts or volcanic chambers beneath the earth. This grants you fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat becomes severe, and so on).</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Oathkeeper Dwarf</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Growing up, you never tried to lie to get what you wanted, and even when necessary, lying makes you uncomfortable. The especially faithful might even have thought that you were blessed by the dwarven god of duty, Kols. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Sense Motive and to Perception DCs against attempts to Lie to you. Furthermore, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks to convince others you speak the truth when you are telling the truth, and you take a –4 circumstance penalty to Lie and to your Deception DC against Sense Motive.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Rock Dwarf</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your ancestors lived and worked among the great ancient stones of the mountains or the depths of the earth. This makes you solid as a rock when you plant your feet. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to Shove or Trip you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that attempt to knock you prone.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Strong Blooded Dwarf</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your blood runs hearty and strong, and you can shake off toxins. You gain poison resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), and each of your successful saving throws against a poison affliction reduces its stage by 2, or by 1 for a virulent poison. Each critical success against an ongoing poison reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 for a virulent poison. </p>
