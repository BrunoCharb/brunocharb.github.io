  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Ancient Ash</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your memory is sharp and clear, and you remember so much. You remember the calm before the storm and the soil after the rain, the acrid tang of magic and the whisper of a song. You remember it all. You become trained in one skill of your choice. At 5th level, you become an expert in that skill.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Enchanting Lily</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You smell ever so sweetâ€”a delicate, floral scent like the intoxicating fragrance of lilies and the soft scent of lilacs. You're trained in Diplomacy (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Make an Impression if the target can smell your fragrance.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Strong Oak</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Most ghorans have bodies of pliable vines and tough stems, but you're covered in sturdy, rough bark and your legs are stable as roots. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to Grapple or Trip you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against effects that would grab you, restrain you, or knock you prone. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to Balance.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Thorned Rose</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your beautiful petals and seemingly smooth skin hide silent barbs to pierce the unwary. Your body is covered with wickedly sharp thorns to discourage those that might prey upon you. You gain the Wicked Thorns reaction.</p>

    <p><strong>Frequency: </strong>Once per day</p>
    <p><strong>Trigger: </strong>You're hit with an unarmed Strike or a Strike with a non-reach melee weapon.</p>
    <p class="separator"></p>
    <p>Several of your thorns break off and hook into your attacker's body. You deal 1d8 piercing damage to the triggering creature. It attempts a basic Reflex save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. On a critical failure, the creature also takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage as your thorns embed in its flesh.</p>
    <p>At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d8, and the persistent piercing damage increases by 1.</p>
