    <p>You break off quills in your attacker's flesh. You deal 1d8 piercing damage to the triggering creature (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.) On a critical failure, the creature also takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage as your quills hook into its flesh. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d8 and the persistent piercing damage increases by 1. </p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">Your metabolism is slow, allowing you to go for days without food and process maladies at a slower rate. You can go for 1 week without food before you begin to starve. Additionally, the onset times and lengths of stages for all diseases and poisons that affect you are increased by 50%. If the onset time or stage is instant or lasts only 1 round, this ability has no effect.</p>
