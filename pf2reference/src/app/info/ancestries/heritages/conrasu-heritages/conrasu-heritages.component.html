<p class="ion-margin-start">You augmented your exoskeleton with magic. You gain one cantrip from the arcane or occult spell list. You can cast this spell as an innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.</p>

  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Rite of Knowing</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You enhanced your exoskeleton with a connection to Axis, allowing you to tap into the infinite knowledge of the plane. You gain the Call to Axis action.</p>

    <p>You call upon the knowledge of Axis to ensure the accuracy of your information. You roll a second time and use the higher result. If you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. If you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.</p>

  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Rite of Light</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your exoskeleton bears small shoots that can share life. When using your Sunlight Healing, you can restore the Hit Points of an adjacent ally instead of yourself. That ally becomes temporarily immune to all uses of Sunlight Healing for 1 day.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Rite of Passage</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your exoskeleton remains connected with the plants that created it. You can ignore difficult terrain and uneven ground caused by undergrowth. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance on narrow surfaces or uneven ground within forests, you aren't flat-footed. When you roll a success attempting one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Rite of Reinforcement</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your woven exoskeleton rivals the hardest armors that can be found. Your exoskeleton is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a speed penalty of –5 feet, and a Strength value of 16, and has the comfort trait. You can never wear other armor or remove your exoskeleton. You can etch armor runes onto your exoskeleton as normal.</p>
