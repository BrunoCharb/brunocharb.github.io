  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Elfbane Hobgoblin</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Hobgoblins were engineered long ago from the unreliable and fecund goblins, to be used as an army against the elves. Although the elves ultimately freed the hobgoblins from their bondage, some hobgoblins retain ancestral resistance to magic, which they refer to as “elf magic.” You gain the Resist Elf Magic reaction.</p>

    <p>Your ancestral resistance to magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the triggering effect is arcane, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.</p>

  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Runtboss Hobgoblin</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You come from a long line of hobgoblins who commanded goblins. You are smaller than other hobgoblins, but goblins still listen to any commands you bellow. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. If you roll a success on an Intimidation check to Coerce a goblin (but not other creatures with the goblin trait), you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Shortshanks Hobgoblin</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins, making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong, muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you in riding and climbing—and you've trained at riding in a saddle from an extremely early age. You gain the Ride feat. Additionally, you are not flat-footed while you Climb.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Smokeworker Hobgoblin</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your family have been alchemists, engineers, and scientists for generations, on projects bringing smoke and fire to the field of battle. You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a concealed creature if that creature is concealed only by smoke.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Steelskin Hobgoblin</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">When you are cut or burned, your body responds by forming tough but flexible callouses over the site of the injury. Over time, this makes the most vulnerable sections of your body harder and more resistant to damage. Many steelskin hobgoblins intentionally use blades and flame to scar themselves in intricate patterns, though this isn't universal. Your flat check to recover from persistent physical (including bleed), energy, or poison damage is DC 13 (rather than DC 15), or DC 8 when provided particularly effective assistance.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Warmarch Hobgoblin</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You come from a line of wandering mercenaries, constantly on the march and scavenging food on the trail. If you fail, but not critically fail, to Subsist in the wilderness, you can still keep yourself fed with poor meals. When exploring, you can Hustle twice as long before you have to stop.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header">
  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Warrenbred Hobgoblin</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. When you are underground, you can use the Seek action to sense undetected creatures within a 30-foot burst instead of a 15-foot burst. In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.</p>
