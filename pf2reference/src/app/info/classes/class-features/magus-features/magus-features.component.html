    <h2>Combining Your Abilities</h2>
    <p>As a magus, you have multiple special actions and abilities that can be used in combination with your spells. You can enter your Arcane Cascade stance with either Spellstrike or a normally cast spell, so it could be in your best interest to cast a spell to buff yourself at the beginning of a fight and enter Arcane Cascade, rather than going for an early Spellstrike. You can usually stay in Arcane Cascade for a long time, though if you find out an enemy has a weakness to a certain damage type, such as fire, you might want to refresh your stance with a fire spell to take advantage of the bonus damage. It's often worth it to cast your conflux spells and make a Strike either on a turn where you can't make a Spellstrike, or as the last action on your turn after a Spellstrike. Sometimes, it might be worth it to cast a conflux spell even if you think you'll miss, because it can still recharge your Spellstrike for your next turn. Since a lot can ride on your Spellstrike, which uses your multiple attack penalty, it's much better if used as the first attack of the turn!</p>

    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <p>You'll see the following key term in many magus class features.</p>
    <p><strong>Stance: </strong>A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.</p>

<ion-row>
  <div class="ion-margin-start">
    <h3 class="red-text">During Combat Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You channel spells through your weapon or body to hit enemies with a powerful attack and spell combination. Because your spells per day are limited, you often rely on trusty, carefully chosen cantrips and focus spells. When necessary, you know how to win a fight without magic.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">During Social Encounters...</h3>
    <p>Your education and breadth of experience make you knowledgeable about many subjects. You can contribute information related to your scholarly pursuits, especially about magic.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">While Exploring...</h3>
    <p>Your flexibility means you might look for magical auras, remain on guard, or even sneak around. Your ability to fill different niches means that your role often depends on the talents of the other members of your group.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">In Downtime...</h3>
    <p>You split your time between magical pursuits, like researching spells and crafting items, and martial practice, such as retraining combat abilities to learn new techniques.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">You Might...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Continually refine your spell and item selections to suit your personal style, or prepare battle plans and spell lists for a variety of situations.</li>
      <li>Socialize with scholars of magic and veteran combatants alike, seeking out masters to teach you new techniques.</li>
      <li>Overreach with ambitious plans that pull you in too many directions at once.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="red-text">Others Probably...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wonder how you can keep on top of two disparate disciplines at the same time.</li>
      <li>Believe you have a broad enough skill set to take care of yourself in most situations.</li>

    <h2>Class Features</h2>
  </div>
</ion-row>
<ion-row>
  <div class="ion-margin-top">
    <h3 class="red-text">Ancestry And Background</h3>
    <p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Initial Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Arcane Spellcasting</h3>
    <p>You study spells so you can combine them with your attacks or solve problems that strength of arms alone can't handle. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a material component pouch.</p>
    <p> At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>
    <p> As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2–2: Magus Spells per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level.</p>
    <p> Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Roll. </p>
    <h4>Heitening Spells</h4>
    <p> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain levels. </p>
    <h4>Cantrips</h4>
    <p> A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. </p>
    <h4>Spellbook</h4>
    <p> Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your name scrawled on the cover.</p>
    <p> Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures (see Learn a Spell). Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-level slots as normal.</p>
    <p> If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the Wizard Dedication feat), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Spellstrike</h3>
    <p>You've learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magical and physical attacks together. You gain the Spellstrike activity.</p>

        <p><strong>Frequency: </strong>until recharged (see below)</p>
        <p class="separator"></p>
        <p>You channel a spell into a punch or sword thrust to deliver a combined attack. You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into your attack instead. Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. Your spell is coupled with your attack, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the penalty until after you've completed the Spellstrike. The infusion of spell energy grants your Strike the arcane trait, making it magical.</p>
        <p> After you use Spellstrike, you can't do so again until you recharge your Spellstrike as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You also recharge your Spellstrike when you cast a conflux spell that takes at least 1 action to cast; casting a focus spell of another type doesn't recharge your Spellstrike.</p>
      </ion-card-content>
    </ion-card>
    <h3 class="red-text">Spellstrike Specifics</h3>
    <p> Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack. </p>
    <p><strong>One Target: </strong>The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>
    <p><strong>Reach: </strong>The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>
    <p><strong>Ancillary Effects: </strong>Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>
    <p><strong>Multiple Defenses: </strong>Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.</p>
    <p><strong>Invalid or Immune Target: </strong>If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>
    <p><strong>Variable Actions: </strong>Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>
    <p><strong>Metamagic: </strong>You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Arcane Cascade</h3>
    <p>After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.</p>

        <p><strong>Requirements: </strong>You used your most recent action to Cast a Spell or make a Spellstrike.</p>
        <p class="separator"></p>
        <p>You divert a portion of the spell's magical power and keep it cycling through your body and weapon using specialized forms, breathing, or footwork. While you're in the stance, your melee Strikes deal 1 extra damage. This damage increases to 2 if you have weapon specialization and 3 if you have greater weapon specialization. Any Strike that benefits from this damage gains the arcane trait, making it magical.</p>
        <p> If your most recent spell before entering the stance was one that can deal damage, the damage from the stance is the same type that spell could deal (or one type of your choice if the spell could deal multiple types of damage). If the spell couldn't deal damage, this stance's bonus damage depends on the spell's school. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Abjuration or Evocation: </strong>Force</li>
          <li><strong>Conjuration or Transmutation: </strong>same type as your weapon or unarmed attack</li>

    <h3 class="red-text">Hybrid Study</h3>
    <p>Your extensive physical training and carefully chosen magic combine to form a unique and dangerous fighting style that's more than the sum of its parts. You choose one field of hybrid study to represent your particular combination of skills. Your hybrid study gives you a special ability, usually tied to Spellstrike or Arcane Cascade, and it determines your initial conflux spell. Hybrid Studies can be found here.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Conflux Spells</h3>
    <p>You learn a conflux spell from your hybrid study, and you can cast additional conflux spells by selecting certain feats. Conflux spells are magus-specific spells created for combat and are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to both study your spellbook and perform a physical regimen.</p>
    <p> Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Magus Feats (Level 2)</h3>
    <p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Skill Feats (Level 2)</h3>
    <p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">General Feats (Level 3)</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Skill Increases (Level 3)</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this skill increase to become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you are already trained.</p>
    <p> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Aility Boosts (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Ancestry Feats (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Lightning Reflexes (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Weapon Expertise (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Studious Spells (Level 7)</h3>
    <p>Your hybrid study grants you additional spells that can enhance your power in combat. You gain two special 2nd-level studious spell slots, which can be used to prepare spider climb, true strike, water breathing, and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. You add any spells from this class feature to your spellbook. At 11th level, the extra slots increase to 3rd level and you add haste and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. At 13th level, the extra slots increase to 4th level and you add fly and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study.</p>
    <p>See specific hybrid studies for more information.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Weapon Specialization (Level 7)</h3>
    <p>You can inflict greater injuries with your favored weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Alertness (Level 9)</h3>
    <p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Expert Spellcaster (Level 9)</h3>
    <p>Your fundamental understanding of magic improves, making your spells harder to resist. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Resolve (Level 9)</h3>
    <p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Medium Armor Expertise (Level 11)</h3>

    <p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Greater Weapon Specialization (Level 15)</h3>
    <p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Juggernaut (Level 15)</h3>
    <p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Master Spellcaster (Level 17)</h3>
    <p>You fortify your spells with masterful prowess. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Medium Armor Mastery (Level 17)</h3>
    <p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Double Spellstrike (level 19)</h3>
    <p>You can extend the magic of spells you store with Spellstrike. After you make a Spellstrike with a spell cast from a spell slot, you retain an echo of the spell, stored in your body. The next time you Spellstrike, you can cast the same spell again without expending a spell slot.</p>
    <p>If you choose to cast a different spell with Spellstrike, or you go 1 minute without using the stored spell, the stored spell dissipates harmlessly.</p>
