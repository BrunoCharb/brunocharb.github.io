    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <p>You'll see the following key terms in many rogue class features.</p>
    <p><strong>Debilitation: </strong>Debilitations apply conditions and other negative effects to a creature. When the creature is affected by a new debilitation, any previous one it was affected by ends.</p>
    <p><strong>Flourish: </strong>Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.</p>

  <div class="ion-margin-start">
    <h3 class="red-text">During Combat Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You’re a precision instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against rank-and-file soldiers.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">During Social Encounters...</h3>
    <p>Your skills give you multiple tools to influence your opposition. Pulling cons and ferreting out information are second nature to you.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">While Exploring...</h3>
    <p>You sneak to get the drop on foes and scout for danger or traps. You’re a great asset, since you can disable traps, solve puzzles, and anticipate dangers.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">In Downtime...</h3>
    <p>You might pick pockets or trade in illegal goods. You can also become part of a thieves’ guild, or even found one of your own.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">You Might...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hone your skills through intense practice, both on your own and out in the world. </li>
      <li>Know where to attain illicit goods. </li>
      <li>Skirt or break the law because you think it’s meaningless or have your own code.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="red-text">Others Probably...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Find you charming or fascinating, even if they think they know better than to trust you. </li>
      <li>Come to you when they need someone who is willing to take risks or use questionable methods. </li>
      <li>Suspect you’re motivated primarily by greed.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="ion-margin-start">
    <h3 class="red-text">Ancestry And Background</h3>
    <p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
      and background, as described in Chapter 2.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Initial Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
      noted at the start of this class.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Rogue's Racket</h3>
  <p>As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases. Choose a rogue’s racket. </p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Sneak Attack</h3>
  <p>When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.</p>
  <p> As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Surprise Attack</h3>
  <p>You spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven’t acted are flat-footed to you.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Rogue Feats</h3>
  <p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a rogue class feat.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Skill Feats</h3>
  <p>You gain skill feats more often than others. At 1st level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Skill Increases (Level 2)</h3>
  <p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.</p>
  <p> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Deny Advantage (Level 3)</h3>
  <p>As someone who takes advantage of others’ defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself. You aren’t flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Genreal Feats (Level 3)</h3>
  <p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Ability Boosts (Level 5)</h3>
  <p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Ancestry Feats (Level 5)</h3>
  <p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Weapon Tricks (Level 5)</h3>
  <p>You have become thoroughly familiar with the tools of your trade. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons as well as the rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and unarmed attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against a flat-footed creature while using an agile or finesse simple weapon or unarmed attack, or when using any of the listed weapons, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack.</p>
  <h3 class="red-text">Evasion (Level 7)</h3>
  <p>You’ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragons’ breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
