    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <p>You'll see the following key terms in many fighter class features.</p>
    <p><strong>Flourish: </strong>Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.</p>
    <p><strong>Open: </strong>These maneuvers work only as the first salvo in the attacks you make on your turn. You can use an action with the open trait only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.</p>
    <p><strong>Press: </strong>Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.</p>
    <p> Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)</p>
    <p><strong>Stance: </strong>A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.</p>

    <h2>Roleplaying the Fighter</h2>
  </div>
</ion-row>
<ion-row>
  <div class="ion-margin-start">
    <h3 class="red-text">During Combat Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You strike with unmatched accuracy and use specialized combat techniques. A melee fighter stands between allies and enemies, attacking foes who try to get past. A ranged fighter delivers precise shots from a distance.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">During Social Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You can be an intimidating presence. This can be useful when negotiating with enemies, but is sometimes a liability in more genteel interactions.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">While Exploring...</h3>
    <p>You keep up your defenses in preparation for combat, and keep an eye out for hidden threats. You also overcome physical challenges in your way, breaking down doors, lifting obstacles, climbing adeptly, and leaping across pits.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">In Downtime...</h3>
    <p>You might perform manual labor or craft and repair armaments. If you know techniques you no longer favor, you might train yourself in new ones. If you’ve established your reputation, you might build an organization or a stronghold of your own.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">You Might...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Know the purpose and quality of every weapon and piece of armor you own.</li>
      <li>Recognize that the danger of an adventurer’s life must be balanced out with great revelry or ambitious works.</li>
      <li>Have little patience for puzzles or problems that require detailed logic or study.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="red-text">Others Probably...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Find you intimidating until they get to know you—and maybe even after they get to know you. </li>
      <li>Expect you’re all brawn and no brains.</li>
      <li>Respect your expertise in the art of warfare and value your opinion on the quality of armaments.</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="separator"></p>
        <p>You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.</p>
