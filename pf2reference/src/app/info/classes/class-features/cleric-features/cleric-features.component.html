    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <p>You'll see the following key terms in many cleric class features.</p>
    <p><strong>Metamagic: </strong>Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.</p>

    <h3 class="red-text">During Combat Encounters...</h3>
    <p>If you’re a warpriest, you balance between casting spells and attacking with weapons— typically the favored weapon of your deity. If you’re a cloistered cleric, you primarily cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">During Social Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. Because you’re wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">While Exploring...</h3>
    <p>You detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. You might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">In Downtime...</h3>
    <p>You might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">You Might...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other worshippers of your deity. </li>
      <li>Know the teachings of your religion’s holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma. </li>
      <li>Cooperate with your allies, provided they don’t ask you to go against divine will.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="red-text">Others Probably...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Find your devotion impressive, even if they don’t understand it. </li>
      <li>Expect you to heal their wounds. </li>
      <li>Rely on you to interact with other religious figures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="red-text">Ancestry And Background</h3>
    <p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Initial Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Dieity</h3>
    <p>As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder are found here, along with their alignments, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.</p>

    <p>A list of all deities can be found here. (in developpement)</p>
    <h4>Anathema</h4>
    <p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>
    <p> Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities, and casting lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity isn't limited this way, but their alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>
    <p> If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Divine Spellcasting</h3>
    <p>Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>
    <p> As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–9: Cleric Spells per Day on page 120.</p>
    <p> Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls. </p>
    <h4>Heightening Spells</h4>
    <p> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. </p>
    <h4>Cantrips</h4>
    <p> A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Divine Font</h3>
    <p>Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional heal or harm spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between heal or harm. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention.</p>
    <p><strong>Healing Font: </strong>You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only heal spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>
    <p><strong>Harmful Font: </strong>You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only harm spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Doctrine</h3>
    <p>Even among followers of the same deity, there are numerous doctrines and beliefs, which sometimes vary wildly between clerics. At 1st level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. The doctrines presented in this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest. Each doctrine grants you initial benefits at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your doctrine’s second, third, fourth, fifth, and final doctrines respectively.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Cleric Feats (Level 2)</h3>
    <p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a cleric class feat.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Skill Feats (Level 2)</h3>
    <p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">General Feats (Level 3)</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Skill Increases (Level 3)</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.</p>
    <p> You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text"> Ability Boosts (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Alertness (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Ancestry Feats (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Resolve (Level 9)</h3>
    <p>You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Lightning Reflexes (Level 11)</h3>
    <p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Divine Defense (Level 13)</h3>
    <p>Your training and your deity protect you from harm. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Weapoon Specialization (Level 13)</h3>
    <p>You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Miraculous Spell (Level 19)</h3>
    <p>You're exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using divine spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the Maker of Miracles feat to gain a second slot.</p>
