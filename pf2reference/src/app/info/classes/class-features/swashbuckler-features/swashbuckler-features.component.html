    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <p>You'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities. </p>
    <p><strong>Finisher: </strong>Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some actions with the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.</p>
    <p><strong>Flourish: </strong>Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.</p>
    <p><strong>Stance: </strong>A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take an action that has the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.</p>

  <div class="ion-margin-start">
    <h3 class="red-text">During Combat Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">During Social Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You are equally likely to charm or intimidate othersâ€”or both. You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">While Exploring...</h3>
    <p>You keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">In Downtime...</h3>
    <p>You might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">You Might...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present.</li>
      <li>Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation.</li>
      <li>Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="red-text">Others Probably...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.</li>
      <li>Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your style.</li>
      <li>Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Class Features</h2>
  </div>
</ion-row>
<ion-row>
  <div class="ion-margin-start">
    <h3 class="red-text">Ancestry And Background</h3>
    <p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Initial Proficiencies</h3>
    <p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Panache</h3>
    <p>You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.</p>
    <p> You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including Tumble Through and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style. At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).</p>
    <p> While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache. </p>
    <p>Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Swashbuckler's Style</h3>
    <p>As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or- death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. </p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Precise Strike</h3>
    <p>You strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.</p>
    <p> As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Confident Finisher</h3>
    <p>You gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action.</p>
