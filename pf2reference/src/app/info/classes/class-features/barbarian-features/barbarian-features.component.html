    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <p>You'll see the following key terms in many barbarian class features.</p>
    <p><strong>Flourish: </strong>Flourish actions are techniques that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.</p>
    <p><strong>Open: </strong>These maneuvers work only as your first salvo on your turn. You can use an open action only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.</p>
    <p><strong>Rage: </strong>You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.</p>

  </div>

<ion-row>
  <div class="ion-margin-start">
    <h3 class="red-text">During Combat Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way through. Offense is your best defense—you’ll need to drop foes before they can exploit your relatively low defenses.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">During Social Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion can’t get the job done.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">While Exploring...</h3>
    <p>You look out for danger, ready to rush headfirst into battle in an instant. You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow, and you wade into the risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water’s surface. If something needs breaking, you’re up to the task!</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">In Downtime...</h3>
    <p>You might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">You Might...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration. </li>
      <li>Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium. </li>
      <li>Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness—and punch anyone who says this conflicts with your distaste for patience and tedium.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="red-text">Others Probably...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold your own in a fight. </li>
      <li>See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society. </li>
      <li>Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent until the fight is done.</li>

        <p>You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier.

    <h3 class="red-text">Instinct</h3>
    <p>Your rage wells up from a dominant instinct—one you learned from a tradition or that comes naturally to you. Your instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid certain behaviors, grants you increased damage and resistances at higher levels, and allows you to select feats tied to your instinct. </p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Barbarian Feats</h3>
    <p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a barbarian class feat.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Skill Feats (Level 2)</h3>
    <p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Deny Advantage (Level 3)</h3>
    <p>Your foes struggle to pass your defenses. You aren’t flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">General Feats (Level 3)</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Skill Increases (Level 3)</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.</p>
    <p> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Ability Boosts (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts below 18.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Ancestry Feats (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.</p>

    <p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Weapon Specialization (Level 7)</h3>

    <p>See specific instincts for more information.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Lightning Reflexes (Level 9)</h3>

    <h3 class="red-text">Raging Resistance (Level 9)</h3>

    <h3 class="red-text">Greater Juggernaut (Level 13)</h3>
    <p>You have a stalwart physiology. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead.
