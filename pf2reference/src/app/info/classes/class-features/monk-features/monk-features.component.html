    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <p>You'll see the following key terms in many monk abilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Flourish: </strong>Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.</p>
    <p><strong>Incapacitation: </strong>An ability with this trait can take a character out of the fight. But when you use an incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of success of its saving throws for that effect by one step.</p>
    <p><strong>Ki Spells: </strong>By tapping into a supernatural inner reserve called ki, you can create magical effects. Certain feats grant you special spells called ki spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first ki spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to meditate in order to reach inner peace.</p>
    <p> When you first gain a ki spell, decide whether your ki spells are divine spells or occult spells. You become trained in spell attacks and spell DCs of that tradition and your key spellcasting ability is Wisdom.</p>
    <p> Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>
    <p><strong>Stance: </strong>A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take an action that has the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.</p>

  <div class="ion-margin-start">
    <h3 class="red-text">During Combat Encounters...</h3>
    <p>You speed into the fray, dodging or leaping past obstacles with acrobatic maneuvers. You strike opponents in a rapid flurry of attacks, using your bare fists or wielding specialized weapons that you mastered during your monastic training. Stances let you change up your combat style for different situations, and ki abilities allow you to perform mystic feats like healing yourself and soaring through the air.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">During Social Encounters...</h3>
    <p>Your perceptiveness lets you see through falsehoods, and your philosophical training provides insight into any situation.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">While Exploring...</h3>
    <p>You climb up walls, dodge traps, overcome obstacles, and leap over pits. You usually stay toward the outside of the group to protect more vulnerable members, and you’re well suited to looking for danger or moving stealthily.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">In Downtime...</h3>
    <p>You diligently exercise, eat healthy foods, meditate, and study various philosophies. You might also take up a craft that you strive to perfect.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">You Might...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain a regimen of physical training and meditation. </li>
      <li>Face adversity with a calm and measured approach, never panicking or succumbing to despair. </li>
      <li>Look to the future for ways you can improve, while remaining at peace with your present self.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="red-text">Others Probably...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Marvel at your feats of physical prowess.</li>
      <li>Think you’re more than a bit uptight, given your vows and tenets.</li>
      <li>Come to you for philosophical advice.</li>

        <p class="separator"></p>
        <p>Make two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. As it has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.</p>
      </ion-card-content>
    </ion-card>
    <h3 class="red-text">Monk Feats</h3>
    <p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a monk class feat.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Powerful Fist</h3>
    <p>You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4. Most people take a –2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Skill Feats (Level 2)</h3>
    <p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats are listed in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>

However, you still need an item such as handwraps of mighty blows to gain an item bonus to attack rolls or increase your attacks' weapon damage dice.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Skill Increases (Level 3)</h3>
    <p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.</p>
    <p> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Ability Boosts (Level 5)</h3>
    <p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>

    <h3 class="red-text">Weapon Specialization (Level 7)</h3>
    <p>You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary.</p>
    <h3 class="red-text">Metal Strikes (Level 9)</h3>
    <p>You can adjust your body to make unarmed attacks infused with the mystic energy of rare metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron and silver. This allows you to deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</p>

    <p>You have made great progress in your personal studies of enlightenment. Choose one of the saving throws you selected for path to perfection or second path to perfection.

    <h3 class="red-text">Adamantine Strikes (Level 17)</h3>
