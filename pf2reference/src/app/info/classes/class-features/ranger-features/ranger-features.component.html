    <h2>Warden Spells</h2>
    <p>Your relationship with the world around you extends from the physical to the magical. Certain feats grant you
      warden spells, which are a type of focus spells. It costs 1 Focus Point (FP) to cast a focus spell. When you gain
      your first warden spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 FP. You refill your focus pool during your daily
      preparations, and you regain 1 FP by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with nature.</p>
    <p> Your warden spells are primal spells. When you first gain a warden spell, you become trained in primal spell
      attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Wisdom. </p>
    <p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus
      spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 FP. The full
      rules for focus spells appear here.</p>

    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <p>You'll see these key terms in many ranger class features.</p>
    <p><strong>Flourish: </strong>Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much
      exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. </p>
    <p><strong>Open: </strong>These maneuvers work only as the first salvo in the attacks you make on your turn. You can
      use an action with the open trait only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Press: </strong>Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press
      trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action
      when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.</p>
    <p> Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure
      don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect
      instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)</p>
