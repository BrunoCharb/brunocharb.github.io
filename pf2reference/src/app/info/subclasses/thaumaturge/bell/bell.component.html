</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Bells symbolize the power that sounds and emotions hold over others, soothing with one tone and startling with another. Bells, drums, finger cymbals, and other percussion instruments are most typical, but these implements can be any type of portable musical instrument that is played with one hand. Bell implements are associated with the astrological signs of the daughter and the blossom.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">You can use your bell implement to create three different kinds of music, each of which weakens a foe in a different way. You gain the Ring Bell activity.</p>

    <p><strong>Trigger : </strong>The target of your Exploit Vulnerability makes a Strike or Casts a Spell that would affect you or one of your allies.</p>
    <p><strong>Requirements : </strong>You are holding your bell implement, and the triggering creature is within 30 feet of you.</p>
    <p class="separator"></p>
    <p>Your implement sings out abruptly, disrupting your foe. The piece played depends on whether the trigger was a Strike or Spell, and it applies to the triggering Strike or Spell, except where noted otherwise.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Distracting Cacophony: </strong>The trigger is a spell. You create a musical crash of sonic energy that assails the target and breaks its concentration. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or become stupefied 1 until the end of your next turn (stupefied 2 on a critical failure). The target doesn't have to attempt a flat check to avoid losing the triggering spell, but the discordant ring does lower the spell attack roll or spell DC of the triggering spell from stupefied.</li>
      <li><strong>Disrupting Harmony: </strong>The trigger is a Strike. You create a strangely discordant harmony that sinks into your foe's mind and throws its movements off. The target must succeed at a Will save against your class DC or become your choice of enfeebled 1 or clumsy 1 until the end of your next turn (enfeebled 2 or clumsy 2 on a critical failure).</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Adept Benefit (7th)</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your bell resonates powerfully, causing the effect to last longer. The conditions from Ring Bell last 3 rounds instead of 1 round.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Intensify Vulnerability (9th)</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your reinforced bell can reach into the most basal part of the target's mind, priming it to be vulnerable to the bell's effects. When you successfully Strike the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, your bell implement plays a haunting tone and the creature takes a –2 status penalty on saves against your Ring Bell for 1 round, or a –3 status penalty on a critical hit. This effect has the auditory, emotion, and mental traits.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Paragon Benefit (17th)</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">With your mastery of your bell, you can affect many foes with ease. All the condition values from Ring Bell increase to 2 (or 3 on a critical failure). Ring Bell can trigger off the Strike or spell of any enemy, not just the target of your Exploit Vulnerability; however, in that case, the condition lasts only until the start of your next turn.</p>
