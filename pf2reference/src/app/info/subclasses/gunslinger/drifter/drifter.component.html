</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You're a wanderer traveling from land to land with your gun and a melee weapon as company.
  Maybe you learned to fight with blade and pistol as a Shackles pirate, mastered the hand cannon and katana in Minkai,
  or practiced with a hatchet and clan pistol in Dongun Hold. You win battles by relying on mobility and flexible use of
  your weapons.</p>

    <p>You know trouble can lurk around every corner, and your hands never stray far from your holsters. You can
      Interact to draw a one-handed ranged weapon and can then Interact to draw a one-handed melee weapon. As your first
      action on your first turn, you can Stride as a free action toward an enemy you can perceive. If you can't perceive
      any enemies or can't end your movement closer to one, you can't use this Stride.</p>

    <p>Your last attack failed, but it set you up for another. Make a Strike with your other hand, using a one-handed
      melee weapon or unarmed attack. This Strike uses the same multiple attack penalty as the Strike that failed on the
      last action. Afterward, increase your multiple attack penalty normally.</p>

    <p>You drift across the battlefield, striking down foes as you go. You Stride, and you can Strike up to three times
      at any points during your movement. Each attack must target a different enemy and must be made with a one-handed
      firearm, crossbow, melee weapon, or unarmed attack. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but
      your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you've made all your attacks. Your movement doesn't trigger
      reactions.</p>
