<p class="ion-margin-start">You prefer firearms that work well as weapons in both melee and ranged combat, particularly
  those that allow you to exercise a bit of style and flair. You might be a survivor who cobbled your weapon together
  from the City of Smog's street scrap or a noble wielder of a master smith's bespoke commission for duels among
  Alkenstar's elite. In addition to the combination weapons presented in Pathfinder Guns & Gears, you gain access to the
  triggerbrand combination weapon.</p>

    <p>Should foes parry your blade or dodge your bullets? Neither— they should be watching their purse. Make a melee
      Strike with your combination weapon, and then attempt a Thievery check with a –5 penalty to Steal from your
      target; you can't Steal closely guarded objects or objects that would take a long time to pilfer. You don't need a
      free hand to attempt to Steal something in this manner. If your Thievery check succeeds, the target is flat-footed
      against your ranged attacks until the start of your next turn, and you don't trigger reactions that are normally
      triggered by movement or a ranged attack. These effects occur even if your target has no objects to Steal.

    <p>Your foes are but dross from which you carve and shoot your legend. Make a melee Strike and then a ranged Strike
      with a combination weapon, both against the same enemy; you don't need to change modes to do so. If the melee
      Strike hits, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the attack roll with the ranged Strike. Each attack counts toward
      your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you've made both attacks. If
      both Strikes hit, you deal an additional 2d6 persistent bleed damage to the enemy, and they're dazzled until this
      persistent bleed damage ends.</p>
