    <p class="separator"></p>
    <p>You push outward with your weapon to clear some space before quickly reloading a fresh round. You make an Athletics check to Shove an opponent within your reach using your weapon, then Interact to reload. For this Shove, you don't need a free hand, and you add the weapon's item bonus on attack rolls (if any) to the Athletics check. If your last action was a ranged Strike with the weapon, use the same multiple attack penalty as that Strike for the Shove; the Shove still counts toward your multiple attack penalty on further attacks as normal.</p>

    <p class="separator"></p>
    <p>You go into a vicious spin, smashing your weapon into those nearby and increasing your momentum by firing. All creatures adjacent to you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus your Strength modifier; this increases to 2d6 if your firearm has a striking rune, 3d6 if it has a greater striking rune, and 4d6 if it has a major striking rune. This ability does not apply other effects that increase damage with your firearm Strikes such as weapon specialization. Creatures affected by this attack must attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save is also pushed 5 feet directly away from you.</p>

    <p><strong>Requirements: </strong>You're wielding a firearm that has the kickback or scatter trait, or a two-handed crossbow.</p>
    <p class="separator"></p>
    <p>With unbelievable force, you charge and smash your weapon into a target before digging in your heels and pulling the trigger. Leap or Stride, then make a Strike with the required firearm or crossbow against an adjacent target. This Strike deals an additional 3d8 bludgeoning damage and ignores 10 points of the target's Hardness (if any), or of their shield's Hardness if the target uses Shield Block.</p>
    <p>After the Strike, you become immobilized and position the required weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the chosen weapon has the parry trait. Both effects last until the start of your next turn. If a force would move you while you're immobilized in this way, it must succeed at an appropriate check against your class DC.</p>
