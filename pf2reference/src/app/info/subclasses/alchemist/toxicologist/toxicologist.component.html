<p class="ion-margin-start">You specialize in toxins and venoms of all types. You start with the formulas for two common
  1st-level alchemical poisons in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas. You can apply an injury poison
  you're holding to a weapon you're wielding as a single action, rather than as a 2-action activity, and you can change
  the DCs of your infused poisons to your class DC if it's higher.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">When using advanced alchemy to make poisons during your daily preparations, you can spend
  one batch of reagents to create three poisons in any combination, instead of just two of the same poison.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">You can apply two different injury poisons to the same weapon, though not to a piece of
  ammunition. The two poisons can be up to six levels lower than your level, and you can't use the poisons made without
  spending a batch of infused reagents via perpetual infusions. Applying the two poisons requires a separate action to
  apply each poison. Once completed, you combine the two poisons on the weapon into a double poison with the lower of
  the two poisons' DCs. This double poison is only virulent if both poisons were virulent, and if the poisons have a
  different number of stages, the double poison has a number of stages equal to the poison with the lower number of
  stages. The target takes the effects of both poisons for its current stage.</p>
