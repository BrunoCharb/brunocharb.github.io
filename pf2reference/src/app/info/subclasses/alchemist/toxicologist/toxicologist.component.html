<p class="ion-margin-start">You specialize in toxins and venoms of all types. You start with the formulas for two common
  1st-level alchemical poisons in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas. You can apply an injury poison
  you're holding to a weapon you're wielding as a single action, rather than as a 2-action activity, and you can change
  the DCs of your infused poisons to your class DC if it's higher.</p>

  one batch of reagents to create three poisons in any combination, instead of just two of the same poison.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">You can apply two different injury poisons to the same weapon, though not to a piece of
  ammunition. The two poisons can be up to six levels lower than your level, and you can't use the poisons made without
  spending a batch of infused reagents via perpetual infusions. Applying the two poisons requires a separate action to
  apply each poison. Once completed, you combine the two poisons on the weapon into a double poison with the lower of
  the two poisons' DCs. This double poison is only virulent if both poisons were virulent, and if the poisons have a
  different number of stages, the double poison has a number of stages equal to the poison with the lower number of
  stages. The target takes the effects of both poisons for its current stage.</p>
