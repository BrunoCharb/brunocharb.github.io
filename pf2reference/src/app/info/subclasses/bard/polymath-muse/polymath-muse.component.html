<p class="ion-margin-start">Your muse is a jack of all trades, flitting between skills and pursuits. If it's is a
  creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey; if a deity, it might be Desna or Calistria. As a bard with a
  polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up
  your mindâ€”you want to try everything. You gain the Versatile Performance feat and add unseen servant to your spell
  repertoire.</p>
