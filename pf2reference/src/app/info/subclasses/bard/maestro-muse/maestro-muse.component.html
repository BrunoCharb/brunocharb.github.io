</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your muse is a virtuoso, inspiring you to greater heights. If it's a creature, it might be a
  performance-loving creature such as a choral angel or lillend azata; if a deity, it might be Shelyn. As a bard with a
  maestro muse, you are an inspiration to your allies and confident of your musical and oratorical abilities. You gain
  the Lingering Composition feat and add soothe to your spell repertoire.</p>
