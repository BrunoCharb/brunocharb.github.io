<p class="ion-margin-start">People can't help but trust you, whether through your inherent likableness or your firm insistence on sticking to the truth. You have a way about you that gets others talking, and you've developed interrogative techniques to help you get to the truth of your investigations.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">You are trained in Diplomacy. You gain the No Cause for Alarm skill feat. You can also Pursue a Lead over the course of a conversation rather than spending dedicated time looking into the lead, provided the conversation lasts 1 minute or longer. For example, while trying to Make an Impression, you could pursue the creature you're conversing with as a lead, and you could Pursue a Lead about an object while someone is telling you information about that object. You also gain the Pointed Question action.</p>

    <p>You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the right way. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can see and have been conversing with. Attempt a Diplomacy check against the creature's Will DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Critical Success: </strong>The target must directly answer your question. It doesn't have to answer truthfully, but you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Perception DC if the creature attempts to Lie to you.</p>
    <p><strong>Success: </strong>As critical success, but the circumstance bonus is +2.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure: </strong>The target can refuse to answer you as normal.</p>
    <p><strong>Critical Failure: </strong>The target can refuse to answer you as normal, and its attitude toward you decreases by one step due to your aggravating attention.</p>
