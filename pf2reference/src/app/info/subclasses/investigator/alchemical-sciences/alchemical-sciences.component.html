<p class="ion-margin-start">Your methodology emphasizes chemical and alchemical analysis, collecting information from unusual particles and fluids found on the scene. You possess enough alchemical know-how to whip up a few tinctures to help you with your cases.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">You're trained in Crafting and gain the Alchemical Crafting skill feat. In addition, you gain a standard formula book for free and learn the formulas for two additional common 1st-level alchemical items, which must be elixirs or tools. Each time you gain a level, you learn the formula for one common alchemical elixir or alchemical tool of any level of item you can create.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start">During your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials—alchemical concoctions that can quickly be turned into elixirs and tools— equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can use the Quick Tincture action to turn one of these vials into an elixir or alchemical tool for which you know the formula.</p>

    <p><strong>Cost : </strong>1 versatile vial</p>
    <p><strong>Requirements : </strong>You know the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, you are holding or wearing alchemist's tools, and you have a free hand.</p>
    <p class="separator"></p>
    <p>You quickly brew up a short-lived tincture. You create a single alchemical elixir or tool of your level or lower without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the end of the current turn.</p>
