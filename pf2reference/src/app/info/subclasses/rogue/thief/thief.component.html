</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Nothing beats the thrill of taking something that belongs to someone else, especially if you can do so completely unnoticed. You might be a pickpocket working the streets, a cat burglar sneaking through windows and escaping via rooftops, or a safecracker breaking into carefully guarded vaults. You might even work as a consultant, testing clientsâ€™ defenses by trying to steal something precious.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start">When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack with a finesse melee weapon, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You are trained in Thievery.</p>
