  <li>You must respect the choices others make over their own lives, and you can’t force someone to act in a particular
    way or threaten them if they don’t.
  </li>
  <li>You must demand and fight for others’ freedom to make their own decisions. You may never engage in or countenance

    <p>You free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all
      damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects
      grabbing, restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect
      that allows a save, or attempt to Escape from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as
      a free action, even if they didn't need to escape.</p>

  takes persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>

  doesn't attempt to break free of an effect, you and all allies within 15 feet can Step, in addition to the triggering
  ally.</p>
