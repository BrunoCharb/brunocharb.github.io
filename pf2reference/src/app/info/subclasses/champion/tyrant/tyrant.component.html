<p class="ion-margin-start">Might makes right, and you subjugate the weak to keep them in their proper place. You gain
  the Iron Command champion's reaction and the touch of corruption devotion spell. After the tenets of evil, add these
  tenets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let no one who is lesser than you wield power over you or lead you.
  </li>
  <li>Mercilessly enforce established hierarchies of masters and servants. Topple or seize control of illegitimate
    hierarchies, such as democratic governments or the arrogant echelons of the celestial planes, and fill power vacuums
    by taking that power for yourself.
  </li>
  <li>Bind the weak to serve you. This tenet doesn't require you to spare foes' lives if you think they would be
    disloyal if pressed into servitude, nor does it require you to keep more servants than you find practical or useful.
  </li>

    <p><strong>Trigger : </strong>An enemy within 15 feet damages you.</p>
    <p class="separator"></p>
    <p>You put an impertinent foe who dared harm you in their proper place. You command your enemy to kneel before you
      in obedience. If they dare to refuse, they must pay the price in pain and anguish. The foe must choose one of the
      following options. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The enemy kneels, dropping prone as a free action.</li>
      <li>The enemy refuses, and you deal 1d6 mental damage to it. This damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 9th
        level, 4d6 at 12th level, 5d6 at 16th level, and 6d6 at 19th level.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, your Strikes against the triggering creature deal 1 extra damage until the end of your next turn.
      You choose whether the damage type is evil or negative each time you use this reaction. This extra damage
      increases to 2 at 9th level and 3 at 16th level.</p>

  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Divine Smite (9th)</h3>

<p class="ion-margin-start">The regrets of disobedience linger. If an enemy refuses your Iron Command, it takes
  persistent evil damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Exalt (11th)</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">When you use Iron Command, each enemy within 15 feet of you other than the triggering
  creature must also either drop prone or take mental damage (the enemy chooses). These creatures take only minimum
  damage (typically 3 damage at 11th level, 4 at 12th, 5 at 16th, and 6 at 19th), and the effects they take can't be
  adjusted by anything that changes your Iron Command. For instance, the Iron Repercussions feat couldn't turn the
  damage into persistent mental damage for creatures other than the triggering creature.</p>
