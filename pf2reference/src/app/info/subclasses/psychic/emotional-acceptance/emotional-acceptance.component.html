</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">The mind's truths come not in learned words or mathematical formulas but in deeper feelings and sensations. Emotions unlock the door to your powerâ€”you might consider your heart the source of your strength, or you might find that the infinite complexity felt in a moment expresses your power more efficiently than any string of mystic words ever could.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your thought components are emotions. You might summon the sense of freedom to buoy you through the air or let fear grip your heart even as you plant it in another's mind. Emotion components tend to impart abstract or vivid effects to your visual and auditory spell manifestations as well as more intangible flashes of emotion, such as swirls of joyous color or a sense of growing melancholy.</p>

    <p>Your unleashed psyche gives you closer connections to the emotions of your allies, letting you project reassurance and strength that replenishes their mind and body. Choose one of the two benefits to grant one ally within 30 feet that you can see. That ally is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ally gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws against mental effects until your psyche ends.</li>
      <li>The ally regains Hit Points equal to 2 + double your level.</li>
