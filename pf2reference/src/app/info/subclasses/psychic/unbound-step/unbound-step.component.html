  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Phase Bolt</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your phase bolt temporarily sends the target's cover out of phase if it hits. On a success, reduce the target's circumstance bonus to AC (if any) by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. Your phase bolt also gains the following amp.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Amp: </strong>Your bolt leaves phase completely, becoming invisible and intangible until it's already embedded in the targetâ€” giving the impression it simply teleported itself into place. The target is flat-footed against the attack. Additionally, the bolt ignores an amount of Hardness or resistance to piercing damage equal to half the spell's level. On a critical success, the target can't be affected by teleportation effects until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Amp Heightened (+1): </strong>The bolt's damage increases by 2d4 instead of 1d4.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Warp Step</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You warp space more compactly, granting you a +10-foot status to your Speed instead of a +5-foot status bonus when you warp step. The spell also gains the following amp.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Amp: </strong>Space contracts with hardly a thought, letting you Cast the Spell as a single action.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Amp Heightened (4th): </strong>You twist space so completely you don't need to travel the interposing distance. You can choose to instead teleport to a space within your line of sight and line of effect with a range equal to your double your Speed (after applying the status bonus from warp step). This grants the spell the teleportation trait.</p>
