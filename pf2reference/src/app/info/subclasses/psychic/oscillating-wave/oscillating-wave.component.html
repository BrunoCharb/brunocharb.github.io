</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">At the heart of all things is energy. Though it may change its form or resting place, it is eternal, fundamental, the purest of building blocks. Your powers let you shift energy—either concentrating it in a single point to explosive end or freezing objects by plundering it away— in an endless oscillation of temperature.</p>

  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Conservation of Energy</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Energy can't be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed. Whenever you use your magic to add or remove energy, you must then balance it with the opposing force. The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell or a standard psi cantrip from your conscious mind, decide whether you're adding energy or removing it. Once you add energy, you must remove energy the next time you cast one of these spells. When you Refocus, you restore yourself to a neutral state, allowing you to once again freely choose whether you add or remove energy on your next spell.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Adding Energy: </strong>The ability gains the fire trait, any damage it deals is fire damage, and any resistance it grants is to cold damage. It loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Removing Energy: </strong>The ability gains the cold trait, any damage it deals is cold damage, and any resistance it grants is to fire damage. It loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals. Fiery body grants ray of frost instead of produce flame when cast this way.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Mindshift: </strong>When you use an action that has the mindshift trait, you can choose to add or remove energy to it instead of making it mental. Alter it as normal for adding or removing energy and change any save it requires to a Reflex save.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Produce Flame</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You can drastically increase the heat against adjacent targets. When using produce flame as a melee attack, increase the damage dice of the initial damage (but not the persistent damage) from d4s to d6s. Your produce flame also gains the following amp.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Amp: </strong>You project pure heat that causes a target to combust. The initial damage changes to 1d10 fire damage (not adding your ability modifier) plus 1 fire splash damage. When using amped produce flame as a melee attack, increase the damage dice of the initial damage from d10s to d12s. You are not harmed by splash damage from amped produce flame.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Amp Heightened (+1): </strong>Instead of using produce flame's normal heightened entry, the initial damage increases by 1d10 (1d12 for melee) and the splash damage increases by 1. The persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases by 1d4.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Ray of Frost</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Your ray of frost reaches even further. The range increases to 180 feet. Your ray of frost also gains the following amp.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Amp: </strong>You drain thermal energy at a distance, using what you plunder to replenish yourself. The ray deals 1d10 cold damage. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes (after applying resistances and the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.</p>
<p class="ion-margin-start"><strong>Amp Heightened (+1): </strong>The initial damage increases by 1d10 instead of 1d4.</p>
