  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Construct Innovation</h2>
</ion-row>

<p class="ion-margin-start">Your innovation is a mechanical creature, such as a clockwork construct made of cogs and
  gears. It's a prototype construct companion, and you can adjust most of its base statistics by taking feats at higher
  levels, such as Advanced Companion. If you use the Overdrive action, your construct gains the same Overdrive benefits
  you do, and it also takes the same amount of fire damage on a critical failure.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">You know how to spend additional time directing, controlling, or programming your construct
  innovation for a more complex plan of action. You can spend 2 actions to Command instead of 1 when commanding your
  construct companion; your construct companion can then use an additional action (normally 3 actions, rather than
  2).</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">Choose one initial construct modification to apply to your innovation, either from the
  following or from other initial construct modifications to which you have access. These modifications alter the
  construct's abilities or form.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Initial Modifications</h3>
</ion-row>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accelerated Mobility:</strong> Actuated legs, efficient gears in the wheels or treads, or add-on boosters
    make your construct faster. Your innovation's Speed increases to 40 feet.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Amphibious Construction:</strong> Increased buoyancy, rudders, and a means of propulsion like a fluked
    tail or powerful propeller make your construct able to travel in water. Your innovation gains a swim Speed of 25
    feet.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Increased Size:</strong> You built your construct innovation bigger than most. Your construct is Large. If
    you have this modification and your construct innovation becomes an advanced construct companion or otherwise gains
    the ability to become Large, you can immediately change increased size to a different initial construct
    modification.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Manual Dexterity:</strong> Your construct innovation has articulated hands or similar appendages with
    significant manual dexterity. It can perform manipulate actions with up to two of its limbs. As normal for a
    companion, it still can't wield weapons or held items that don't have the companion trait, and it can't activate
    items.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Projectile Launcher:</strong> Your construct has a mounted dart launcher, embedded cannon, or similar
    armament. Your innovation gains a ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning or piercing damage (you choose
    when you pick this modification). The attack has the propulsive trait and a range increment of 30 feet.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sensory Array:</strong> Additional sensory devices give your innovation low-light vision and darkvision,
    as well as imprecise tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Wonder Gears:</strong> You map specialized skills into your construct's crude intelligence. Your
    innovation becomes trained in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.
  </li>
</ul>

  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Breakthrough Modifications (7th)</h3>
</ion-row>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Advanced Weaponry:</strong> You've powered up your construct's weaponry. Choose one of your construct's
    unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial weapon modification, chosen any initial weapon modifications to
    which you have access. The unarmed attack must meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as being a melee
    attack for entangling form), and since it's an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain requirements, such as being
    a simple weapon for complex simplicity.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Antimagic Construction:</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal
    known as noqual or created magical protections entirely of your own devising, you've made your innovation highly
    resilient to spells. Your construct innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and AC against
    spells.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Climbing Limbs:</strong> With appendages that can claw or create suction, your construct becomes a capable
    climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Durable Construction:</strong> Your innovation is solidly built; it can take significant punishment before
    being destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Marvelous Gears:</strong> Your innovation gains expert proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.
    For any of these skills in which it was already an expert (because of being an advanced construct companion, for
    example), it gains master proficiency instead. If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, these
    proficiencies improve to master, or legendary if your construct innovation was already an expert. You must have the
    wonder gears modification to select this modification.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Turret Configuration:</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary
    turret. Your construct companion can transform as a single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning into a
    turret in its space (or transforming back from a turret into its normal configuration). While it's a turret, your
    innovation is immobilized, but the damage die from its projectile launcher increases to 1d6 and the range increment
    increases to 60 feet. You must have the projectile launcher modification to select this modification.
  </li>
</ul>

<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Revolutionary Modifications (15th)</h3>
</ion-row>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Flight Chassis:</strong> You fit your construct with a means of flight, such as adding rotors or
    rebuilding it with wings and a lightweight construction. Your innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Miracle Gears:</strong> As you perfect your innovation's cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its
    Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a language of your choice from among the languages you know.
    Your construct gains the ability to use actions that require greater Intelligence, like Coerce and Decipher Writing.
    Finally, your construct becomes legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills of your choice. You must
    have the marvelous gears modification to select this modification.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Resistant Coating:</strong> Your innovation is hard to damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all
    damage (except adamantine).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Runic Keystone:</strong> You've incorporated a device similar to a runestone into your innovation,
    allowing it to hold a property rune, even though it isn't a weapon or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects
    your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever properties
    it would normally grant to a weapon to your innovation's unarmed attacks, following all the requirements as normal
    (for instance, a vorpal rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed attacks); if the rune affects only ranged
    attacks, it has no effect unless your innovation has a built-in ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial
    modification, for example). If the rune would affect the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or armor itself,
    like glamered, the rune has no effect when etched into your construct.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Wall Configuration:</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary
    battlefield emplacement. It can unfold as a 2-action activity that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual
    form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend through
    your innovation's original space. While your construct is a wall, it can't take any actions except to use the same
    activity to transform back, and it can't defend itself easily, making it flat-footed and giving it an additional â€“2
    status penalty to its AC. The wall blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation has half its maximum HP or
    fewer, at which point holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to
    slip through.
  </li>
</ul>
