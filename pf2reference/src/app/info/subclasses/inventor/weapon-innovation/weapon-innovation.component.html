  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Weapon Innovation</h2>
</ion-row>

<p class="ion-margin-start">Your innovation is an impossible-looking weapon augmented by numerous unusual mechanisms. It
  begins with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple
  or martial weapon to which you have access. You can instead use the statistics of a 1st-level common simple or martial
  weapon of your choice, or another 1st-level simple or martial weapon to which you have access, but you must pay the
  monetary Price for the weapon. An innovation weapon can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same
  way as an ordinary weapon. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it,
  even if they would normally be trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons. If you use the Overdrive action, you
  can choose to change the additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage.</p>

<p class="ion-margin-start">Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to your innovation, either from the
  following or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. These modifications grant additional
  weapon traits, sometimes with extra abilities. A modification might give your weapon the versatile trait with a damage
  type that the weapon could already deal, either from its base damage type or from an existing versatile trait. In that
  case, if you select that modification, you can instead choose to give the weapon the versatile trait for a different
  damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>

</ion-row>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blunt Shot (Ranged Only):</strong> AYour weapon innovation can file the edges off your ammunition and
    adjust the blunt force of the shot to deliver a bludgeoning attack when necessary, as well as to avoid striking a
    lethal blow with an otherwise deadly shot. Your innovation gains the nonlethal and versatile B traits. You can
    choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Complex Simplicity (Simple Weapon Only):</strong> Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step
    (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). In addition, it gains one of the following traits of your choice:
    versatile B, versatile P, or versatile S.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Weighting (One-handed Melee Weapon Only; Can't Have the Agile, Attached, or Free-hand
    Trait):</strong> Your weapon's modified weight distribution can increase power in exchange for taking more hands to
    wield. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait, with a damage die one size higher than the weapon's normal weapon
    damage die size (for instance, a longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your innovation also gains the
    versatile B trait.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Entangling Form (Melee Only):</strong> You've altered your weapon to including tangling wires or straps,
    or to have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains the grapple and trip traits.

    you've made special ammunition you can swiftly alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for bludgeoning,
    piercing, and slashing. When you Interact to use the modular trait, you can also choose to give the weapon the
    nonlethal trait if it doesn't currently have it, or to remove that trait if it's currently nonlethal.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pacification Tools (Melee Only):</strong> Softer materials make your weapon suited to knock out instead of
    kill, and special protrusions let you catch weapons and disarm your foes. Your innovation gains the disarm and
    nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Segmented Frame:</strong> You can knock down and slash your foes with sharp, curved blades added to your

  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Breakthrough Modifications (7th)</h3>
</ion-row>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Advanced Rangefinder (Ranged Only):</strong> A carefully tuned scope or targeting device makes your weapon
    especially good at hitting weak points. Your innovation gains the backstabber trait and increases its range
    increment by 10 feet.

    attacks. It gains the backstabber and versatile P traits. If the weapon has light Bulk, it also gains the
    concealable trait.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Integrated Gauntlet (One-Handed Weapon Only; Can't Have the Two-Hand Trait):</strong> Combining your
    weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using
    your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Manifold Alloy:</strong> You've devised several alloys that contain useful properties of various metals,
    and you replace a number of parts of your weapon or its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your weapon
    innovation is cold iron and silver. This means you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as
    demons, devils, and fey.
  </li>

</ul>

<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Revolutionary Modifications (15th)</h3>
</ion-row>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Attack Refiner:</strong> Your weapon makes minute recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure the
    next lands true. Your innovation gains the backswing and shove traits.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Deadly Strike:</strong> Through precise calculation, you've found the perfect shape for your weapon to
    deal extreme damage on a well-placed strike. Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your innovation was
    already deadly, it increases its deadly die to d12 instead of gaining deadly d8.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Damage:</strong> You've made your innovation more powerful than other weapons of its kind.
    Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). As normal, you
    can't increase your die by more than one size, so this modification isn't cumulative with complex simplicity.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Extensible Weapon (Melee only):</strong> You've found a way to construct your weapon so that it can extend
    while leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the reach
    trait, it increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Impossible Alloy:</strong> Other inventors claim it's not even technically possible, but you've managed to
    create several metal alloys that seem to work for only you. These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to any one
    of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine, djezet, inubrix,
    noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite). This means you deal more damage to a variety of creatures, though you don't
    apply any of the other special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Momentum Retainer (Melee only):</strong> A special weighted device lets your weapon retain more of its
    momentum when you attack. Your innovation gains the forceful and versatile B traits.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Omnirange Stabilizers (Ranged only):</strong> You've modified your innovation to be dangerous and
    effective at any range. If your innovation had the volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise, increase your
    innovation's range increment by 50 feet or an amount equal to the weapon's base range increment, whichever is more.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Rune Capacity:</strong> Whether you've dabbled with orichalcum or found another engineering solution,
    you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have
    one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency
    weapon).
  </li>
</ul>
