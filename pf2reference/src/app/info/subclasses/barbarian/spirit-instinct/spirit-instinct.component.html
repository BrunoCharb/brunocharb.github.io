  <h2 class="ion-margin-start">Spirit Instinct</h2>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Whether you are emotionally sensitive to the spirits around you; worship ancestors or
  apparitions; or are haunted by the specter of an ancestor, relative, friend, or foe, your rage takes the form of a
  spiritual possession.</p>

<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Anathema</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">Disrespecting corpses or spirits is anathema to your instinct; defending yourself against
  undead creatures is not.</p>
<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Spirit Rage (Instinct Ability)</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">While raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 3 and change its
  damage type to negative or positive, instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack (choose each time
  you Rage). If you choose to deal negative or positive damage, your weapon or unarmed attack gains the effects of the
  ghost touch property rune, which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the
  divine and necromancy traits, plus negative or positive, as appropriate.</p>
<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Specialization Ability (7th)</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">When using spirit rage, increase the damage from Rage from 3 to 7. If you have greater
  weapon specialization, instead increase the damage when using spirit rage to 13.</p>
<ion-row class="small-header ion-text-center">
  <h3 class="ion-margin-start">Raging Resistance (9th)</h3>
</ion-row>
<p class="ion-margin-start">You resist negative damage, as well as damage dealt by the attacks and abilities of undead
  creatures, regardless of the damage type.</p>
