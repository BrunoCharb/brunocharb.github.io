<p class="ion-margin-start">The savage, uncontrollable call of the natural world infuses you, granting you the ability
  to change your shape and take on the ferocious form of a wild creature. You are trained in Intimidation. You also gain
  the Wild Shape druid feat. You gain the wild morph order spell. Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations of
  civilization is anathema to your order. (This doesn’t prevent you from buying and using processed goods or staying in
  a city for an adventure, but you can never come to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place your
  permanent home.)</p>
