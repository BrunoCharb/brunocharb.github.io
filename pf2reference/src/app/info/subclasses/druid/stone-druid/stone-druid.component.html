<p class="ion-margin-start">You're as enduring as stone, and you take comfort in its steadfast presence, both natural
  and worked. You're trained in Crafting. You also gain the Steadying Stone druid feat. You gain the crushing ground
  order spell. Poisoning or polluting the land and heedlessly carving the earth to plunder its natural resources are
  anathema to your order (this doesn't prevent you from responsibly digging or mining).</p>
