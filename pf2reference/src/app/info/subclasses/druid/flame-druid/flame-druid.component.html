<p class="ion-margin-start">You feel a kinship with flames and can use them for succor and destruction. You're trained
  in Acrobatics. You also gain the Fire Lung druid feat. You gain the wildfire order spell. Allowing unnatural fires to
  spread or preventing natural fires from occurring in a way that harms the environment are anathema to your order (this
  doesn't prevent you from using fire destructively or force you to combat a controlled or natural fire).</p>
