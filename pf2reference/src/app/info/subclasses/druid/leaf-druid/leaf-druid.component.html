<p class="ion-margin-start">You revere plants and the bounty of nature, acting as both a gardener and warden for the
  wilderness, teaching sustainable techniques to communities, and helping areas regrow after disasters or negligent
  humanoid expansion. You are trained in Diplomacy. You also gain the Leshy Familiar druid feat. You gain the goodberry
  order spell, and you increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Committing wanton cruelty to plants
  or fungi or killing plants unnecessarily is anathema to your order. (This doesnâ€™t prevent you from defending yourself
  against plants or fungi or harvesting them when necessary for survival.)</p>
