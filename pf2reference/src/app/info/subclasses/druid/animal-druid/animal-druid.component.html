<p class="ion-margin-start">You have a strong connection to beasts, and you are allied with a beast companion. You are
  trained in Athletics. You also gain the Animal Companion druid feat. You gain the heal animal order spell. Committing
  wanton cruelty to animals or killing animals unnecessarily is anathema to your order. (This doesnâ€™t prevent you from
  defending yourself against animals or killing them cleanly for food.)</p>
